/**
 * A class's stored API omits the members it inherits from classes of its own subproject. Within
 * that subproject the invalidator walks the hierarchy instead; another subproject only sees the
 * stored API (the analysis it looks up carries no relations), so it is given hashes composed from
 * the class's and its ancestors' own hashes, taking the ancestors from the stored linearization.
 * Ancestors in other subprojects come from their own analyses: a class does not recompile when
 * an upstream ancestor changes, so the members it materialised from it may be stale.
 * An ancestor contributes its extraHash rather than its apiHash: that covers its class side only,
 * since members of a companion object are not inherited. Its implicit members are added from both
 * sides, since a companion's implicits are in the implicit scope of its descendants.
 *
 * A trait also gets, per name, a hash of the contributions of itself and its trait ancestors only,
 * under the name with [[ForwarderSuffix]]. A class mixing the trait in has forwarders for exactly
 * those members, and for the private fields of those traits, which their extraHashes cover and
 * which are hashed under the bare suffix. A change that reaches the trait only through a class
 * ancestor moves the composed hash but none of these. No client uses these names.
